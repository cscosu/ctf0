Hello, and welcome to the Cybersecurity Club's first annual recruitment CTF!

Each challenge asks your team to discover a hidden flag using various techniques. All flags follow the format
`CSCOSU{...}`, where `...` may be anything. The point-values of each challenge roughly correspond to difficulty.

The purpose of this challenge is simply to get your feet wet. You can find the flag on the [home page](/).
