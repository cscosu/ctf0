The system administrator decided to create his own password manager that he could use over the network. You can access
it using the following command:

```bash
nc ctf.reynoldsbd.net 4003
```

Unfortunately, the manager itself is password-protected, but we were able to get a copy of its source code and an
example password database. See if you can figure out how to break into the remote password manager and steal the flag!
