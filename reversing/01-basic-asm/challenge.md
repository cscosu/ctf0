# Basic ASM

**Points:** 30

**Category:** Reversing

We found this program (`snippet.asm` below), but we're having some trouble figuring it out. What's the value of `%eax`
when the last instruction (the `NOP`) runs?

Hint: your answer should be of the form `CSCOSU{...}`, where `...` is the value of `%eax` in base 10.
