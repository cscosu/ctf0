# Towers of Hanoi

**Points:** 50

**Category:** Reversing

Everyone loves the [Towers of Hanoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) puzzle. Well it appears you need to
win a special version of that game in order to find the flag. The game doesn't seem to be working, though... Can you win
anyway? Perhaps by loading a winning solved game?
