# Internet Inspection

**Flag:** `CSCOSU{flag_07ff7fbdb7b8c3c36ba8b5d3bfc885f752f296f4}`

Inspecting the page source reveals a short script which un-jumbles a large array of binary data into the HTML of the
hidden elements. It then dynamically loads that HTML into the DOM and proceeds to obfuscate by overlaying the
checkerboard image.

The checkers, and some other CSS tomfoolery for blurring, makes it tough to determine just how to make the elements
legible. Fortunately, you can use a developer JS console to directly read the DOM contents in the same way they are set
during page load:

```js
>> $('#content').html()
"<td>7/21/2014</td><td>Dr. Claudio Drake</td><td>Towards developing the next generation of robotic assistants for cardiovascular surgery</td><td>flag_07ff7fbdb7b8c3c36ba8b5d3bfc885f752f296f4</td>"
```
