The login page linked to in the challenge description uses a JavaScript function embedded directly in the page's source
code to validate the user's credentials. This validation happens against *hard coded* usernames and passwords that
should be clearly visible. Typing one of these username/password combinations will take the user to the "secret area"
containing the key.

Alternately, the URL for the "secret area" is openly visible and requires no real authentication to access.
